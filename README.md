This is a simple implementation of a guessing number game where the program generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. The program displays a hint that the user guessed 
number is either high or low and asks the user to guess again. After the user has successfully guessed the correct number, it displays a Correct message with the number of guesses that
the user took to get the correct number.
